Michael's Maven Archetypes
==========================

What is this?
-------------
Just some Maven Archetypes created by and for Michael Righi, but you know, you can use them too.*

Should I use this?*
------------------
Probably not.  

These archetypes were initially written for personal use, and as a result there's some me-specific stuff in them.
For example, I hope you like the Java package name "com.michaelrighi" because that's hard-coded in all the archetypes. :-)

One day I hope to get around to making these more suitable for general use, but in the meantime I decided to make this
public to share with a couple of friends, and I figured maybe a few strangers could benefit from this too.

Until I make these more suitable for general uses, I think you should probably be using one of the archetypes
